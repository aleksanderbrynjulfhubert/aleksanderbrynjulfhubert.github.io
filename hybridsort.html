                    <p>
                    Modern computing usually involves many complicated tasks that need to be executed efficiently and quickly. With large amounts of data we begin to run up against time and memory barriers that require efficient solutions to overcome. While at Emory my CS323 <em>Data Structures and Algorithms</em> course was one of the first times that I ran into these issues that needed a solution more clever than cleaning up my code to fix. This task was to speed up array sorting against the benchmark of a quicksort implementation.<br>
                    <br>
                    Now I had learned that quicksort was fast, with an average case of <em>O(n log n)</em> but with a worst case of <em>O(n&sup2;)</em> this was our opportunity to speed up our algorithm againt the benchmark.
