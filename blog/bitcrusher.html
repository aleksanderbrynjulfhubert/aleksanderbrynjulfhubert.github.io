                    <p>Music creation has changed a lot in the past century. Before the advent of computers sound effects needed to be created using some sort of analogue method. Whether this was putting a metal sheet infront of an output device to create reverb or changing the acoustics of the room to produce the correct timbre the soundwaves interacted with some sort of surface or medium which modified the wave.</p>
                    <p>In the realm of analogue signal processing these transformations of the wave are often continuous. There are cases where a non-continuous transformation takes place such as a scratch across a record that results in a speaker pop. These sudden jumps are usually something that we try to avoid but in the case of bitcrushing slight jumps are exactly what we are looking for. When using a bit crusher what we are attempting to do by lowering the resolution of the audio signals we create small discontinuities. If these discontinuities are small the bit crushing effect gives a nice warmer quality to the sound, if the are too large we get pops from the speakers. </p>
